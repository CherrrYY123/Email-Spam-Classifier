# Email-Spam-Classifier

## Overview
This project provides code for classifying emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. With the increase in online consumption of products and services, consumers face a huge problem with the abundance of spam messages in their inboxes. These messages are often promotional or fraudulent, causing important emails to get lost in the clutter.
## Project
- Email Classification: Uses a trained model to classify emails as spam or non-spam.
- GUI Application: Includes a graphical user interface for easy interaction and testing.
## Files
- `AI_ClassAssignmentNLP.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and explanation for the classifier.

- `GUI_SPAM.py`: Python script for the graphical user interface.

- `README.md`: Project documentation.

- `Sample Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating sample predictions using the trained model.

- `Screenshot 1 - S.png`: Screenshot of the GUI with a spam classification example.

- `Screenshot 2 - NS.png`: Screenshot of the GUI with a non-spam classification example.

- `classifier.pkl`: Pre-trained classifier model file.

- `count_vectorizer.pkl`: Pre-trained count vectorizer model file.
